Introduction
========================================================

Asia Pacific is the world as largest mobile and internet region but also one of the most diverse regions in terms of the levels of both economic and mobile market development. 

In this case study, we would like to study Internet and Mobile penetration in ASEAN as one of the most growing area in Asia Pacific, and the effective way delivering this information by using shiny application.


Dataset
========================================================

The dataset is taken from World Bank Database (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx):
* Internet Penetration for ASEAN Countries 
* Mobile Penetration for ASEAN Countries 

From those 2 data, we calculate average on Internet and Mobile penetration among those countries.

Shiny is used to present the timeseries data:
* Shiny allows interactivity
* Shiny is relatively simple (short turn-around)


Analysis
========================================================

The data shows that Internet and Mobile penetration trend among ASEAN countries are totally diversified. 

Singapore dominate Internet and Mobile penetration in the region. While Cambodia and Myanmar in the bottom 2.

The following code plots Internet and Mobile Trend in Singapore:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataset <- read.csv('./data/dataset.csv')
library(ggplot2)
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
qplot(year, countriesInternet, data=subset(dataset, as.character(countries)=="Singapore"), color=year)
qplot(year, countriesMobile, data=subset(dataset, as.character(countries) =="Singapore"), color=year)
```


Effective Plot
========================================================

Single country plot: clear info, no countries comparison trend.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(year, countriesInternet, data=subset(dataset,as.character(countries)=="Singapore"), color=year)
```

***

Time series plot: too much info but can see countries comparison trends
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(year, countriesInternet, data=dataset, color=countries, size=countriesInternet)
```


Conclusion
========================================================

The full timeseries is plotted as web application using Shiny instead:

Based on the observed trend, the following are conclusions:
* Shiny interactivity allows the user to focus on a number of information year by year clearly  & observe trend over time
* Singapore has the highest internet and mobile penetration  in the region with 73% (2013) 155.92%(2013). However, poor penetration in other ASEAN Countries is bringing down SEAâ€™s average to 34%(2013)
* Myanmar is the lowest internet and mobile penetration in SEA's with only 1.20(2013) and 12.83% (2013)
